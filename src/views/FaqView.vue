        <h2 class="title">What is Mahlzeit?</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to list all the Berlin's local canteens or restaurants lunch menu offers.<br/>
          Mahlzeit helps you to find online where to get your favorite lunch for your workding days.
        </p><br/>

        <h2 class="title">What is the story behind Mahlzeit?</h2>
        <p>
          After some years working in Berlin's Adlershof, the founder of Mahlzeit was surprised to find<br/>
          that it was nearly impossible to find a local database with all local lunch menus. So he made <br/>
          it his personal mission to bring great menus closer to the workers.<br/><br/>
          Oh, and the name? Mahlzeit is the word Germans use to say "Good mealtime!" when it is mealtime.
        </p><br/>

        <h2 class="title">How does Mahlzeit work?</h2>
        <p>
          It's really quite straightforward - simply select your work place on the homepage, and we'll show you<br/>
          all the great restaurants that offer a lunch menu to you. Choose the canteen that tickles your fancy<br/>
          and go to get your meal.
        </p><br/>
        <h2 class="title">What kind of restaurants are listed on Mahlzeit?</h2>
        <p>
          We personally curate a high-quality and diverse selection of restaurants or canteens with lunch menu in<br/>
          your area. This can range from a top neighbourhood Italian trattoria to well-regarded national burger chain.
        </p><br/>
        <h2 class="title">Why aren't you listing my area yet?</h2>
        <p>
          We are rapidly expanding throughout Berlin and will hopefully be working with canteens near you soon!
